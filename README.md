Developed a state-of-the-art **Deep Learning model** for lip-reading, incorporating **Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs)** and **Bidirectional LSTM** layers to achieve high transcription accuracy. Implemented this
model using **Keras**, **TensorFlow**, **NumPy** and **Pandas**.
Hosted the model on a StreamLit web application, ensuring easy access and usability. This technology holds
significant potential to empower the deaf and hard of hearing community by enhancing communication and
accessibility.
